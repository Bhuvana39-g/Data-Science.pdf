# Task 2 â€“ Deep Learning Image Classification

## Description
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and preprocessed MNIST dataset
- Normalized pixel values and reshaped images
- Built a CNN model:
  - 2 convolutional layers
  - Max pooling layers
  - Dense layers with ReLU and softmax
- Trained the model for 5 epochs
- Achieved ~98.9% accuracy on test data
- Visualized accuracy and loss over epochs
- Saved the trained model (`mnist_cnn_model.h5`)

## Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Output
The trained model and visualizations are included.
